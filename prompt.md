Fix the errors in this code. Do not add comments to the code. Do not change variable or function names unless necessary. When creating new variables or functions, follow camelCase. Always try to adapt to my coding style.


 Create a latex code for this, my ds lab assignment. Here's the structure:



Page 1:


Large Heading : DS Self Study\n Experiment 24\n Merge k sort


My details: Submitted by: \n Basith Ali KP \n S3 CSE A


Page 2:


Heading : Algorithm 


Next page Code: Code should've proper formatting 

Last page : screeshots of the output of code

Overall the document should look modern and clean.


Create a C style pseudocode for this code. Only include necessary functions. It should look more like code than algorithm. But it should be short and precise.
