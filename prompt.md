 Create a latex code for this, my ds lab assignment. Here's the structure:



Page 1:


Large Heading : DS Self Study\n Experiment 24\n Merge k sort


My details: Submitted by: \n Basith Ali KP \n S3 CSE A


Page 2:


Heading : Algorithm 


Next page Code: Code should've proper formatting 

Last page : screeshots of the output of code

Overall the document should look modern and clean.


Create a C style pseudocode for this code. Only include necessary functions. It should look more like code than algorithm. But it should be short and precise.



In a network computers are connected with each other like a graph, a computer wants to sent message to other computers such that the message reachs other computer in minimum hops , simulate this using a suitable algorithm 
computer 0->1,2
computer 1->3,4
computer 2->5
computer 3->6
computer 4->7
computer 5->7
